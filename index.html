        <p>Dear Provider,</p>
        <br><br><br>
    
        <p>
            Rockwell Health LLC has partnered with Accrify to verify your credentials as a provider. Enclosed is our
            application, please complete it in full and return to us along with the requested documents as listed below.
            Please note that we use the same application for all professions/specialties, therefore not all fields may
            be applicable to you.
            <br><br>
            The process of credentialing and privileging has multiple steps and therefore may take up to sixty days to
            complete. In order to expedite the process, your application should be completed without blanks or
            missing requested documents. If anything is missing, the process will be delayed and could result in
            forfeiture of your privileges. We will make every effort to process your application in a timely and
            efficient
            manner. We may need to reach out to you if we have any follow up questions or concerns, please be sure
            to respond in a timely manner. You will be notified by Rockwell Health LLC once your credentials have
            been verified.
            <br><br>
    
            You can always reach out to us if you have any questions regarding the application prior to submission.
            Our goal is to assist you in getting verified as quickly as possible, while ensuring that we are compliant
            with federal and state standards and of nationally recognized accrediting organizations including The Joint
            Commission.
            <br><br><br><br>
    
            Thank you,
            <br><br>
